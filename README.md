# Basel Blog Project

## Overview

I'm starting a new journey by building a website and blogging about it in public. This is a new approach for me, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it unfolds. By sharing my progress, I hope to not only learn from the community but also contribute to it. Your feedback and insights will be invaluable.

## Progress So Far

- **Design**: I have a design in mind from Figma and will implement it based on what fits and what I like.
- **Front-End**:
  - Added a navigation bar.
  - Set up Redux.
  - Decided to use React and Django for the stack as it's what I'm most familiar with.
- **Dark/Light Mode**:
  - Added a state in the Redux store for managing dark and light modes.
  - Open to suggestions on whether this is the best approach.
- **Styling**: Using Tailwind CSS and Material UI for styling.

## Tech Stack

- **Front-End**: React
- **Back-End**: Django
- **State Management**: Redux
